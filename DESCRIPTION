Description: SISeg applies general bootstrap, Bayesian and 
    asymptotic techniques to provide statistical inferences on
    segregation indices. For each of the defined indices, it provides
    point estimates and confidence intervals. It also compares
    the difference between indices from two different data 
    sources.
